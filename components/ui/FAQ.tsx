      question: "Why real-time vs. a regular AI notetaker?",
      answer: "Unlike regular AI notetakers like Otter or Granola that work after your meeting ends, Cluely provides real-time meeting intelligence during your calls. While other AI meeting assistants create meeting summaries afterward, Cluely helps you answer technical questions, handle objections, and perform better during high-stakes conversations."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is Cluely for?",
      answer: "Cluely is designed for sales professionals, founders, and customer success managers who need instant access to information during high-pressure meetings."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Cluely free?",
      answer: "We offer a generous free tier that includes essential features. For power users needing unlimited real-time assistance, we offer a Pro plan."
    },
    {
      question: "How is it undetectable in meetings?",
      answer: "Cluely runs locally on your system and captures audio directly from your output device. It does not join the call as a bot, so no one else knows it's there."
    },
    {
      question: "What languages and apps are supported?",
      answer: "We currently support Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams in English, with multi-language support coming soon."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I talk to customer support?",
      answer: "Yes, our support team is available via email and live chat to help you with any setup or technical questions."
